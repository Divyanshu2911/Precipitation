Performance Evaluation of Regression Models for Precipitation Prediction
Precipitation prediction plays a pivotal role in various fields such as agriculture, hydrology, and disaster management. 
Accurate forecasts of rainfall or snowfall are crucial for making informed decisions. 
In this project, we embarked on a comprehensive journey to compare the performance of various regression models in predicting precipitation. 
The objective was to determine which model provides the most accurate and reliable forecasts.
